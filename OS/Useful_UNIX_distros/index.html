<h3 id="antix-and-mx">Antix and MX</h3>
<pre><code>MX-14 &quot;Symbiosis&quot;

MX-14 is the current release of MX Linux, a special version of antiX developed in full collaboration with the MEPIS Community, using the best tools and talents from each distro. It is a midweight OS designed to combine an elegant and efficient desktop with simple configuration, high stability, solid performance and medium-sized footprint.

Relying on the excellent upstream work by Linux, MX-14 deploys Xfce4 as Desktop Environment on top of a Debian Stable base; ongoing backports to the Community Repos keep it current. It also incorporates the independent and innovative development products smxi and inxi.


About antiX

antiX is a fast, lightweight and easy to install linux live CD distribution based on Debian Testing for Intel-AMD x86 compatible systems. antiX offers users the &quot;antiX Magic&quot; in an environment suitable for old computers. So don't throw away that old computer yet! The goal of antiX is to provide a light, but fully functional and flexible free operating system for both newcomers and experienced users of Linux. It should run on most computers, ranging from 64MB old PII 266 systems with pre-configured 128MB swap to the latest powerful boxes. 128MB RAM is recommended minimum for antiX. The installer needs minimum 2.2GB hard disk size. antiX can also be used as a fast-booting rescue cd. A special XFCE edition made in collaboration with the MEPIS Community called MX-14 &quot;Symbiosis&quot; is also available.

* It's fast. It only takes a few minutes for a complete installation. 
* Scalable. FAI users manage their computer infrastructures starting from a few computers up to several thousands of machines. 
* Different hardware and different configuration requirements are easy to establish using FAI. You do not need to repeat information that is shared among several machines. 
* Using the FAI class concept, you can group a bunch of similar machines. 
* Installation targets: desktops, servers, notebooks, Beowulf cluster, rendering or web server farm, Linux laboratory or classroom. 
* Linux rollout, mass installation and automated server provisioning are additional topics of FAI. 
* FAI is lightweight. No special daemons are running, no database setup is needed. It's architecture independent, since it consists only of shell, Perl and Cfengine scripts. 
* Easy creation of customized unattended ISO 
* Besides initial installations, it is used for daily maintenance, and can set up chroot environments. 
* Compared to tools like kickstart or cobbler for Red Hat, autoyast for SUSE or Jumpstart for SUN Solaris, FAI is much more flexible. You can tune every small part of your configuration to your local needs using hooks.

<h3 id="network-security-toolkit">Network Security Toolkit</h3>
<pre><code>Welcome to the Network Security Toolkit (NST). This bootable ISO live CD/DVD (NST Live) is based on Fedora. The toolkit was designed to provide easy access to best-of-breed Open Source Network Security Applications and should run on most x86/x86_64 platforms.

The main intent of developing this toolkit was to provide the security professional and network administrator with a comprehensive set of Open Source Network Security Tools. The majority of tools published in the article: Top 125 Security Tools by INSECURE.ORG are available in the toolkit. An advanced Web User Interface (WUI) is provided for system/network administration, navigation, automation, network monitoring, host geolocation, network analysis and configuration of many network and security applications found within the NST distribution. In the virtual world, NST can be used as a network security analysis validation and monitoring tool on enterprise virtual servers hosting virtual machines.

<h3 id="pfsense">PFSense</h3>
<pre><code>The pfSense project is a free network firewall distribution, based on the FreeBSD operating system with a custom kernel and including third party free software packages for additional functionality. pfSense software, with the help of the package system, is able to provide the same functionality or more of common commercial firewalls, without any of the artificial limitations. It has successfully replaced every big name commercial firewall you can imagine in numerous installations around the world, including Check Point, Cisco PIX, Cisco ASA, Juniper, Sonicwall, Netgear, Watchguard, Astaro, and more.

pfSense software includes a web interface for the configuration of all included components. There is no need for any UNIX knowledge, no need to use the command line for anything, and no need to ever manually edit any rule sets. Users familiar with commercial firewalls catch on to the web interface quickly, though there can be a learning curve for users not familiar with commercial-grade firewalls.

<h3 id="ping-partimage-is-not-ghost">PING (Partimage Is Not Ghost)</h3>
<pre><code>PING is a live Linux ISO, based on the excellent Linux From Scratch (LFS) documentation. It can be burnt on a CD and booted, or integrated into a PXE / RIS environment. 
Several tools have been added and written, so to make this ISO the perfect choice to backup and restore whole partitions, an easy way. It sounds like Symantec Ghost(tm), but has even better features, and is totally free. 

Features include: 


Probably the best available Linux toolbox for rescuing a system; 
Backup and Restore partitions or files locally or to the network (MS Network Shared directory, NFS, FTP or SSHFS); 
Backup and Restore the BIOS data as well; 
Either burn a bootable CD / DVD, either integrate within a PXE / RIS environment; 
Possibility to Blank local admin's password; 
Create your own restoration bootable DVD (see the Howto Documentation); 
Partition and Format a disk before installing Windows (so to make sure your unattended Windows installation will happen on the right partition); 

Specific advantages PING brings you over DOS and Ghost : 
Most network cards automatically recognized by the Kernel (unlike DOS); 
Most CD/DVD readers automatically recognized by the Kernel (unlike DOS); 
You don't have to run a Ghostcast server to receive images over the network; 
More supported filesystems; 
You can store an image on several CD/DVD (CD/DVD-spanning); 
You can backup and restore BIOS settings too; 
Much much smaller than WinPE / BartPE; 
etc. 
</code></pre>

<h3 id="puppy-linux">Puppy Linux</h3>
<pre><code>Linux is a free operating system, and Puppy Linux is a special build of Linux meant to make computing easy and fast.

Puppy Linux enables you to save money while doing more work, even allowing you to do magic by recovering data from destroyed PCs or by removing malware from Windows. See these example articles: recovering files from Windows and safe Internet banking with Puppy Linux.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="systemrescuecd">SystemRescueCd</h3>
<pre><code>SystemRescueCd is a Linux system rescue disk available as a bootable CD-ROM or USB stick for administrating or repairing your system and data after a crash. It aims to provide an easy way to carry out admin tasks on your computer, such as creating and editing the hard disk partitions. It comes with a lot of linux software such as system tools (parted, partimage, fstools, ...) and basic tools (editors, midnight commander, network tools). It can be used for both Linux and windows computers, and on desktops as well as servers. This rescue system requires no installation as it can be booted from a CD/DVD drive or USB stick, but it can be installed on the hard disk if you wish. The kernel supports all important file systems (ext2/ext3/ext4, reiserfs, btrfs, xfs, jfs, vfat, ntfs), as well as network filesystems (samba and nfs). 

Based of Gentoo and VERY useful for Gentoo installations especially for UEFI.
