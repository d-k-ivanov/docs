<pre><code>Darkstat captures network traffic and calculates statistics about usage. The reports are served over a simple HTTP server and gives you a nice graphical user interface of the graphs.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="vnstat">vnStat</h3>
<pre><code>vnStat is a network traffic monitor that uses statistics provided by the kernel which ensures light use of system resources. The gathered statistics persists through system reboots. It has color options for the artistic sysadmins.

<h3 id="netstat">netstat</h3>
<pre><code>Netstat is a built-in tool that displays TCP network connections, routing tables and a number of network interfaces. It’s used to find problems in the network.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="ss">ss</h3>
<pre><code>Instead of using netstat, it’s however preferable to use ss. The ss command is capable of showing more information than netstat and is actually faster. If you want a summary statistics you can use the command ss -s.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="nmap">nmap</h3>
<pre><code>Nmap allows you to scan your server for open ports or detect which OS is being used. But you could also use this for SQL injection vulnerabilities, network discovery and other means related to penetration testing.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="mtr">MTR</h3>
<pre><code>MTR combines the functionality of traceroute and the ping tool into a single network diagnostic tool. When using the tool it will limit the number hops individual packets has to travel while also listening to their expiry. It then repeats this every second.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="tcpdump">tcpdump</h3>
<pre><code>tcpdump will output a description of the contents of the packet it just captured which matches the expression that you provided in the command. You can also save the this data for further analysis.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="justniffer">Justniffer</h3>
<pre><code>Justniffer is a tcp packet sniffer. You can choose whether you would like to collect low-level data or high-level data with this sniffer. It also allows you to generate logs in customizable way. You could for instance mimic the access log that apache has.
